# Restricting Storage Account Access to a Specific VNet

## Question

**How will you restrict access to a storage account so that only virtual machines (VMs) in a specific Virtual Network (VNet) can access it?**

### Short Overview

This question evaluates your understanding of Azure network security and storage account access control. It checks whether you know how to enforce network-level restrictions so that only resources from a trusted VNet can access storage.

---

## Answer

To restrict a storage account to a specific VNet:

1. **Disable public access** ‚Äì Block internet traffic to the storage account.  
2. **Enable VNet service endpoints or Private Endpoint** ‚Äì Allow the storage account to be reachable only from the chosen VNet/subnet.  
3. **Configure network rules** ‚Äì Add the VNet/subnet to the storage account firewall rules.

## Detailed Explanation

Azure provides network-level controls for storage accounts. By default, a storage account is accessible from the public internet if the right keys or credentials are used. To lock access down only to VMs in a specific VNet, you can employ the following approaches:

---

### üîí 1. Disable Public Network Access

| Purpose              | Prevents traffic from the public internet                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| How                  | In Storage Account settings ‚Üí Networking ‚Üí Set ‚ÄúPublic network access‚Äù to Disabled |

**Use case:**  
Ensures the storage account can only be reached from trusted VNets or private endpoints.

---

### üåê 2. Use VNet Service Endpoints

| Purpose              | Extends VNet identity to the storage account               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| How                  | Enable Microsoft.Storage service endpoint on the subnet where your VMs run, then allow that subnet in the storage account firewall.|

**Example CLI:**

```bash
az network vnet subnet update \
  --name mySubnet \
  --vnet-name myVnet \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --service-endpoints Microsoft.Storage
```


**Use case:**  
Quick and simple way to restrict storage access to only a specific VNet/subnet.

---

### üîó 3. Use Private Endpoints (Recommended for Production)

| Purpose              | Provides a private IP inside your VNet for the storage account |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| How                  | Create a Private Endpoint in the VNet/subnet. Storage traffic flows entirely over Azure‚Äôs private backbone network.|

**Example CLI:**

```bash
az network private-endpoint create \
  --name myPrivateEndpoint \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --vnet-name myVnet \
  --subnet mySubnet \
  --private-connection-resource-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storageAccountName> \
  --group-id blob
```


**Use case:**  
Secure production workloads where storage traffic should never traverse the internet.

## üß† Real-world Insight

> ‚ÄúIn enterprise environments, we use private endpoints to keep storage traffic within the private VNet. For dev/test, service endpoints are sometimes used as a simpler and cost-effective method. Public network access is disabled in all cases to reduce exposure.‚Äù

## Summary Table

| Method             | Security Level | Use Case                             |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Public Access (default) | ‚ùå Low         | Not recommended for sensitive data |
| Service Endpoints   | ‚úÖ Medium      | Simple setup, subnet-based access  |
| Private Endpoints   | ‚úÖ‚úÖ High       | Production workloads, private IP in VNet |

---

## Key Takeaway

> ‚ÄúTo restrict a storage account to only VMs in a specific VNet, disable public access and configure either service endpoints or a private endpoint for the VNet. Private endpoints provide the highest security level.‚Äù
