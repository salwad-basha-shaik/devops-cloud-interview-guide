# Service Principals vs Managed Identities, Which one is better ?

# Service Principals vs Managed Identities in Azure

## Question

**Service Principals vs Managed Identities — which one is better, and when should you use each?**

### Short Overview

This question tests your knowledge of identity and access management in Azure. Both Service Principals and Managed Identities are used for authentication without user credentials, but they differ in management, security, and use cases.

---

## Answer

Azure provides two main identity approaches for applications:

- **Service Principals** – app identity you create and manage manually  
- **Managed Identities** – system-managed identity that Azure handles for you

---

## Detailed Explanation

When applications, VMs, or services need to authenticate against Azure resources (e.g., Key Vault, Storage, SQL), they must have an identity.

Azure provides two options:

---

### 🔑 1. Service Principal

| Purpose          | An identity (like a user) manually created for apps/services           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credential Mgmt  | Manual – requires client secrets or certificates                         |
| Lifecycle        | Created/rotated/deleted by you                                          |
| Security Risk    | Secrets may be leaked if not rotated properly                           |

**Example CLI to create a Service Principal:**

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac –name my-app –role Contributor
```


**Use case:**

- CI/CD pipelines needing non-interactive login  
- Multi-cloud or hybrid apps requiring Azure access  
- Apps/services running outside Azure needing Azure resource access

### 🤖 2. Managed Identity

| Purpose          | An identity automatically managed by Azure for your resource            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credential Mgmt  | Automatic – no secrets to manage                                        |
| Lifecycle        | Tied to lifecycle of the resource (VM, App Service, Function)          |
| Security Risk    | Very low – Azure rotates credentials automatically                      |

**Types:**

- System-assigned: Lifecycle tied to the resource  
- User-assigned: Standalone identity reusable across multiple resources  

**Example CLI to enable system-assigned identity for a VM:**

```bash
az vm identity assign –name MyVM –resource-group MyRG
```

**Use case:**

- Running code inside Azure (VMs, Functions, App Service, AKS)  
- Avoiding secrets in code or config files  
- Securely accessing services like Key Vault, Storage, Azure SQL

## 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “In production, we prefer Managed Identities because they eliminate the need to store and rotate secrets. For CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions outside Azure), we use Service Principals since they require an explicit identity.”

## Summary Table

| Feature             | Service Principal                       | Managed Identity                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Credential Storage   | Secrets/certificates (manual)          | None (Azure-managed)               |
| Secret Rotation     | Manual                                | Automatic                        |
| Lifecycle Management | By developer                          | By Azure                         |
| Works Outside Azure  | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No                           |
| Security Risk       | Higher (due to secrets)                | Lower (no secrets)                |
| Use Case            | External apps, CI/CD                   | Azure-hosted apps/services        |

## Key Takeaway

> “Use Managed Identities whenever your application runs inside Azure — it’s more secure and requires no secret management. Use Service Principals when your app or service runs outside Azure or when you need fine-grained control over identity lifecycle.”
