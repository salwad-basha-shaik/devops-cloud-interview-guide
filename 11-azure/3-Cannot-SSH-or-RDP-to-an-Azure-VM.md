# Cannot SSH or RDP to a Azure VM, How will you fix it ?

# Cannot SSH or RDP to an Azure VM

## Question

**How do you troubleshoot and fix issues when you cannot SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) into an Azure Virtual Machine?**

### Short Overview

This question checks your knowledge of Azure VM connectivity troubleshooting. It evaluates whether you can diagnose issues across networking, firewall, NSG rules, system configuration, and VM state to restore access.

---

## Answer

To fix SSH/RDP issues with an Azure VM, check the following areas:

- **Networking Layer** – Ensure Public IP, NSG, Route Table, and Firewall allow required ports.
- **VM OS Configuration** – Verify SSH/RDP service is running and listening.
- **Azure Platform Tools** – Use Boot diagnostics, Serial Console, and “Reset password” / “Reset NIC” features.
- **Recovery Options** – Attach the disk to another VM if needed for deep repair.

## Detailed Explanation

Connectivity to an Azure VM depends on multiple layers: Azure networking (NSG, routing), OS-level services (sshd/RDP), and identity (keys/passwords). When troubleshooting:

---

### 🌐 1. Networking Layer Checks

| Check           | Explanation                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Public IP Address| Verify VM has a Public IP if connecting from internet|
| NSG (Network Security Group) | Allow inbound port 22 (SSH) for Linux or 3389 (RDP) for Windows|
| Firewall Rules  | Windows Firewall/Linux iptables must permit SSH/RDP traffic|
| Effective Routes| Confirm no User Defined Route blocks traffic (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 → Blackhole)|

✅ **Fix:** Adjust NSG rules or firewall policies accordingly.

### ⚙️ 2. VM OS & Service Configuration

| Check           | Explanation                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Service running | Linux: `systemctl status sshd`; Windows: RDP service must be running|
| Listening ports | Validate with `netstat -tulnp` (Linux) or `netstat -an` (Windows)  |
| Authentication  | Verify SSH keys or passwords are correct        |

✅ **Fix:** Restart SSH (`sudo systemctl restart sshd`) or enable RDP using Serial Console if needed.

---

### 🛠️ 3. Azure Platform Tools

Azure provides built-in recovery tools:

- **Boot Diagnostics:** View boot logs/screenshots for startup errors.
- **Serial Console:** Direct console access to fix configurations (enable SSH, reset firewall).
- **Reset Password/SSH Key:** Reset credentials from Azure portal.
- **Reset NIC:** Reattach or fix a misconfigured NIC.

✅ **Fix:** Use Azure Portal → Help + Troubleshooting → “Reset password” or “Reset network interface”.

### 💾 4. Recovery Option (Last Resort)

If still inaccessible:

1. Stop the VM  
2. Detach its OS disk  
3. Attach the disk to another healthy VM  
4. Fix OS configuration (sshd, firewall settings, drivers)  
5. Reattach the disk and start the original VM

## 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “In one project, we lost SSH access due to a misconfigured iptables rule. Using Azure Serial Console, I removed the firewall block and regained access without detaching the disk. For Windows VMs, I’ve used the Reset NIC feature when RDP failed due to a corrupt NIC driver.”

## Summary Table

| Layer         | Common Issue                 | Fix                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Public IP     | No IP or incorrect IP       | Assign correct Public IP             |
| NSG Rules     | Port 22/3389 blocked        | Add inbound rule in NSG              |
| Firewall      | OS-level block (iptables or Windows Firewall) | Update firewall rules             |
| Service       | sshd or RDP service stopped | Restart service                     |
| Credentials   | Wrong key or password       | Reset credentials via Azure Portal  |
| Disk/OS Corrupt | Misconfiguration inside VM  | Use Serial Console or attach disk   |

---

## Key Takeaway

> “When an Azure VM is unreachable, troubleshoot in layers: Azure Networking → VM OS Services → Azure Platform Tools → Recovery options. A systematic approach ensures quick recovery of SSH/RDP access.”
