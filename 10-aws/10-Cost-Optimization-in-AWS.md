# Cost Optimization in AWS

## Question

**Explain a cost optimization activity that you performed in your current organization.**

### Short Overview

This question evaluates your real-world experience in reducing cloud expenses by analyzing AWS usage, identifying waste, and implementing cost-saving best practices.

## Answer

One impactful cost optimization activity I performed was **rightsizing EC2 instances** and **implementing S3 lifecycle policies**.

- Rightsizing ensured we used appropriately sized EC2 instances.
- S3 lifecycle rules automatically moved data from S3 Standard to S3 Infrequent Access and Glacier, reducing storage costs.

## Detailed Explanation

Cloud costs can grow rapidly without careful resource management. I focused on two key areas:

---

### ⚡ 1. EC2 Rightsizing

| Problem                                   | Many EC2 instances were over-provisioned (e.g., running m5.4xlarge but CPU utilization ~15%) |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Solution                                  | Used CloudWatch metrics and AWS Trusted Advisor to analyze utilization and recommend smaller instance families (e.g., m5.large instead of m5.4xlarge) |
| Result                                    | Reduced compute costs by 30–35% without impacting performance                               |

### 📦 2. S3 Lifecycle Policies

| Problem                                   | Old application logs and backups kept in S3 Standard, incurring high storage costs           |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Solution                                  | Applied S3 lifecycle rules to transition                                              |
|                                           | - After 30 days → move to S3 Infrequent Access (IA)                                        |
|                                           | - After 90 days → move to S3 Glacier Deep Archive                                           |
| Result                                    | Reduced S3 storage cost by 40%+ while keeping compliance data accessible                     |

## 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “By rightsizing EC2 instances and implementing S3 lifecycle policies, we achieved ~35% monthly savings. Leadership appreciated these activities since they showed immediate ROI without affecting performance or availability.”

## 📊 Summary Table

| Activity        | Problem                              | Solution                                   | Result                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| EC2 Rightsizing | Over-provisioned instances          | Use CloudWatch + Trusted Advisor to downsize | ~30–35% EC2 cost savings    |
| S3 Lifecycle    | Expensive long-term data in S3 Standard | Apply lifecycle policies to IA & Glacier    | ~40% storage cost savings   |

## Key Takeaway

> “Cost optimization is not a one-time task; it’s an ongoing process. Monitoring usage, rightsizing resources, and leveraging storage lifecycle policies can significantly reduce cloud costs while maintaining performance.”
