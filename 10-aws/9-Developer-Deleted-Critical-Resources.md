# Developer Deleted Critical Resources like S3, RDS and EC2. What will you do ?

# AWS Disaster Recovery & Incident Handling

## Question

**A developer accidentally deleted critical resources such as S3 buckets, RDS databases, and EC2 instances. What steps would you take to handle this situation?**

### Short Overview

This question evaluates your incident response, disaster recovery planning, and AWS best practices knowledge. It checks if you know how to recover lost data, mitigate impact, and prevent future accidental deletions.

---

## Answer

If critical AWS resources are deleted, follow these steps:

1. **Contain & Assess** – Verify the scope of deletion and impacted services.
2. **Recover** – Restore data and services using backups, snapshots, or replication.
3. **Communicate** – Notify stakeholders and update status transparently.
4. **Prevent Recurrence** – Enable safeguards like IAM permissions, MFA delete, service control policies, and resource tagging.

## Detailed Explanation

When a developer accidentally deletes critical AWS resources, a structured response combining immediate recovery and long-term prevention is essential.

### 🔎 1. Containment & Assessment

| Step             | Action                                                                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identify resources| Use CloudTrail logs to determine which resources (S3, RDS, EC2) were deleted and by whom |
| Assess impact    | Check dependencies—e.g., was it a production RDS DB? Was the deleted S3 bucket hosting static content or backups? |
| Stop further damage | Revoke developer access or restrict permissions as needed                              |

### 🛠️ 2. Recovery

**🪣 S3 Bucket**
- If versioning enabled → Restore objects from previous versions
- If MFA Delete enabled → Roll back accidental deletions
- Use Cross-Region Replication or AWS Backup to restore from backups

**🗄️ RDS Database**
- Restore from automated backups or manual snapshots
- Use Point-in-Time Recovery if enabled
- For Multi-AZ setups → Failover to standby instance

**🖥️ EC2 Instance**
- Launch new instances from latest AMI or EBS snapshots
- Reattach EBS volumes if they were not deleted

---

### 📢 3. Communication

- Immediately inform stakeholders and application owners
- Provide estimated recovery time (ETA)
- Update incident status continuously via Slack, email, status pages, or other communication channels

### 🔐 4. Prevention (Future Safeguards)

| Control                    | Purpose                                                            |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IAM Policies               | Enforce Principle of Least Privilege to prevent deletion of production resources |
| AWS Backup                 | Centralized backups of S3, RDS, EC2 with retention policies       |
| S3 MFA Delete              | Protect buckets against accidental or malicious deletions         |
| Service Control Policies (SCPs) | Restrict destructive actions in production accounts          |
| Resource Tagging & Monitoring | Tag critical resources and configure CloudWatch alarms on deletions |
| Change Management          | Use approval workflows with AWS Service Catalog/Terraform with reviews|

## 🧠 Real-World Insight

> “In one real incident, a developer deleted an S3 bucket without versioning enabled. Recovery was only possible through cross-region replication backups. Since then, we enforced versioning, MFA Delete, and automated AWS Backup policies across all production resources.”

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

> “In AWS, recovery strongly depends on backups, versioning, and redundancy. To prevent future incidents, enforce IAM least privilege, backup strategies, and robust deletion safeguards.”

👉 **Would you like me to prepare a summary table (like for Kubernetes Services) showing each AWS resource (S3, RDS, EC2) → recovery method → prevention method?**
