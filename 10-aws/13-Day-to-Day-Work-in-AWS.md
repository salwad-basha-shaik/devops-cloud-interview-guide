# What AWS Services Do You Use in Day-to-Day Work?

## Question

**Which AWS services do you commonly use in your daily work, and for what purposes?**

### Short Overview

This question evaluates your practical knowledge of AWS services and how you apply them in real-world DevOps, cloud, and observability tasks.

---

## Answer

As a DevOps Engineer, I frequently use a combination of compute, storage, networking, monitoring, and automation services.

The most common AWS services I use daily are:

- **EC2** – virtual servers for running applications
- **S3** – object storage for data, logs, and backups
- **VPC** – secure networking setup
- **IAM** – access control and permissions
- **CloudWatch** – monitoring and logging
- **EKS/ECS** – container orchestration
- **Lambda** – serverless automation

## Detailed Explanation

AWS provides a vast set of cloud services, but in day-to-day DevOps operations, some services are nearly indispensable as they form the infrastructure, automation, and monitoring backbone.

---

### 🖥️ 1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

| Purpose    | Run scalable virtual machines for workloads                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Hosting applications, bastion hosts, CI/CD runners              |

**Example CLI:**

aws ec2 describe-instances


**Use case:**  
Provisioning application servers, jump hosts, or build agents.

---

### 📦 2. S3 (Simple Storage Service)

| Purpose    | Scalable object storage for data, logs, and artifacts           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Store CI/CD artifacts, logs, Terraform state, backups           |

**Example CLI:**

aws s3 cp file.txt s3://mybucket/


**Use case:**  
Backup strategy, log storage, static website hosting.

---

### 🌐 3. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

| Purpose    | Isolated and secure networking environment                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Create subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, security groups     |

**Use case:**  
Designing secure network layouts for microservices and databases.

---

### 🔐 4. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

| Purpose    | Fine-grained control of access and permissions                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Manage roles, policies, least-privilege access                   |

**Use case:**  
Assign IAM roles to EC2/EKS to avoid hardcoding AWS credentials.

---

### 📊 5. CloudWatch

| Purpose    | Monitoring, logging, and alerting                                |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Set alarms, monitor CPU/memory, centralize logs                 |

**Use case:**  
Create dashboards; set alerts for high error rates; store logs for debugging.

---

### 🐳 6. ECS/EKS (Elastic Container Service / Elastic Kubernetes Service)

| Purpose    | Run containerized workloads                                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Deploy microservices in containers                               |

**Use case:**  
Automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines on Kubernetes or ECS Fargate.

---

### ⚡ 7. Lambda

| Purpose    | Serverless compute for automation                                |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Usage| Event-driven automation (S3 triggers, scheduled tasks)          |

**Use case:**  
Auto-cleanup of unused resources, log processing, security checks.

---

## 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “In my day-to-day work, EC2 and EKS handle workloads, while S3 manages artifacts and logs. IAM enforces security, VPC secures networking, and CloudWatch provides monitoring. I also use Lambda for lightweight automation like cost cleanup and alerting.”

---

## Summary Table

| Service  | Category    | Daily Use Case                 |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| EC2      | Compute     | Run apps, jump hosts           |
| S3       | Storage     | Store logs, artifacts, backups|
| VPC      | Networking  | Secure network design         |
| IAM      | Security    | Access control & roles        |
| CloudWatch | Monitoring | Metrics, logs, alerts         |
| ECS/EKS  | Containers  | Deploy microservices          |
| Lambda   | Serverless  | Automate small tasks          |

---

## Key Takeaway

> “AWS has hundreds of services, but in daily operations, a DevOps Engineer typically works with EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, ECS/EKS, and Lambda to cover compute, storage, networking, security, monitoring, and automation needs.”
