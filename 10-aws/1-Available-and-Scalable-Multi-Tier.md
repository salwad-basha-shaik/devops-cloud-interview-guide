# Designing a Highly Available and Scalable Multi-Tier Application on AWS

## Question

**Explain the reference architecture and key design choices for building a highly available (HA) and horizontally scalable multi-tier app in the cloud.**

### Short Overview

This topic tests your ability to:
- Split an app into web, application, and data tiers
- Distribute tiers across failure domains (AZs/regions)
- Add caching and messaging layers
- Leverage autoscaling, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), security best practices, and observability to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

## Reference Architecture & Key Design Choices

A solid HA & scalable 3-tier design on AWS includes:

- **Global Edge & DNS:** Route 53, CloudFront, AWS WAF
- **Web Tier:** Application Load Balancer (ALB) in multi-AZ public subnets
- **App Tier:** EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) or EKS (Kubernetes) with HPA/ASG, immutable images, blue/green deployments
- **Data Tier:** Managed DB (RDS Multi-AZ) plus Read Replicas / DynamoDB, with ElastiCache for hot data
- **Async Layer:** SQS/SNS/Kafka for decoupling spikes
- **State & Files:** S3 (with replication) for static assets, EFS for shared POSIX storage
- **Networking:** VPC with public/private subnets across ‚â•2 AZs, security groups (SGs), network ACLs (NACLs)
- **Ops:** IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation), CI/CD pipelines, observability, backup & disaster recovery

## Detailed Layer-by-Layer Explanation

### üåê 1) Edge, DNS, and Security
- **Route 53**: Health-based failover and latency-based DNS routing.
- **CloudFront**: Offloads TLS, caches static assets, shields origins.
- **AWS WAF & Shield**: Mitigate L7 attacks, bot control, rate limiting.

### üö™ 2) Web Tier (Stateless)
- **ALB** spanning multiple AZs in public subnets; health checks remove unhealthy targets.
- **TLS Termination** at ALB; enforce HTTPS to origins.
- **Path/Host-Based Routing** for microservices.

### üß† 3) App Tier (Compute & Scale)
Options:
- **EC2 Auto Scaling**: AMI-baked images, launch templates, blue/green or rolling deployments.
- **EKS/Kubernetes**: HPA/VPA, PodDisruptionBudgets, multi-AZ node groups, anti-affinity.
- **Scaling Signals**: CPU, RPS, queue depth, error budgets.
- **Stateless Apps**: Sessions in ElastiCache (Redis) or signed cookies.

### üíæ 4) Data Tier (Consistency & Availability)
- **Relational**: RDS Multi-AZ for HA, Read Replicas to scale reads, point-in-time restore, tuned parameter groups.
- **NoSQL**: DynamoDB (on-demand capacity, DAX for ultra-fast reads).
- **Caching**: ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) for hot data.
- **Files/Objects**: S3 for assets/backups, EFS for shared POSIX files; data lifecycle & replication.

### ‚úâÔ∏è 5) Asynchronous Decoupling
- **SQS** for buffering spikes; auto-scale workers by queue depth.
- **SNS/EventBridge** for fan-out.
- **Kafka/MSK** for streaming, consumer groups for parallelism.

### üõ°Ô∏è 6) Network, Identity, and Secrets
- **VPC**: Public subnets (ALB/NAT), private for app/DB.
- **NAT Gateways** per AZ for HA egress; VPC Endpoints for AWS services.
- **Security Groups & NACLs**: Least-privilege, coarse blocks.
- **IAM Roles** for workloads, **Secrets Manager/SSM** for secrets management.

### üß™ 7) CI/CD, Deployment Safety & Resilience
- **Pipelines**: Automated deployments (GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, ArgoCD), tests/scans, canary or blue/green deployment.
- **Feature Flags** for progressive delivery.
- **Chaos Engineering**: AZ failure drills, game days, graceful degradation paths.

### üìà 8) Observability & SRE Hooks
- **Metrics** (latency, errors, saturation, cost), **logs** (structured), **traces** (OpenTelemetry).
- **SLO Monitoring**: Alert on error budget burns.
- **Runbooks & Auto-remediation**: E.g., scale out or restart unhealthy pods.

### üåç 9) DR & Multi-Region (When Required)
- **DR Patterns**: Pilot-Light, Warm-Standby, Active-Active.
- **Cross-Region Replication**: RDS, S3, DynamoDB global tables.
- **Route 53**: Failover/latency routing with health checks; periodic DR drills.

## üß† Real-world Insight

> ‚ÄúOur traffic bursts 10√ó during campaigns. We autoscale workers off SQS queue depth, keep the web/app tiers stateless, and push all static content through CloudFront. RDS handles writes, while read replicas + Redis serve hot paths. Blue/green cuts deploy risk to near zero.‚Äù

## Key Takeaway

‚ÄúDesign for failure domains (AZ/region), keep compute stateless, cache aggressively, decouple with queues, and automate everything with IaC, CI/CD, and observability‚Äîso the system scales horizontally and heals itself.‚Äù
