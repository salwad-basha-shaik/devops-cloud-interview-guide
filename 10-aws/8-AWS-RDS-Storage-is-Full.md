# What to Do When AWS RDS Storage is Full?

## Question

**What actions should you take if your AWS RDS database storage becomes full?**

### Short Overview

This question evaluates your knowledge of how RDS handles storage limits and what strategies to apply to prevent downtime or data loss. Running out of storage can degrade performance or cause the DB instance to fail.

---

## Answer

When AWS RDS storage is full, you can:

- Enable Storage Auto-Scaling – automatically increase storage when near full capacity
- Manually Increase Storage – modify the DB instance size via AWS Console or CLI
- Clean Up Unnecessary Data – delete old logs, temporary tables, or archives
- Optimize Tables/Indexes – reclaim space using VACUUM (Postgres) or OPTIMIZE TABLE (MySQL)
- Move Cold Data – offload old or unused data to S3 or Glacier
- Monitor Storage – set CloudWatch alarms to proactively manage growth

---

## Detailed Explanation

If RDS storage is exhausted, the instance may stop accepting writes or crash. AWS provides multiple ways to manage and prevent this to ensure high availability.

### ⚡ 1. Enable Storage Auto-Scaling

| Purpose    | Automatically increases storage when near capacity        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact     | Zero downtime scaling                                       |
| Best for   | Production environments with unpredictable growth          |

**CLI Example:**

aws rds modify-db-instance 
–db-instance-identifier mydb 
–max-allocated-storage 1000


**Use case:**  
E-commerce apps experiencing unexpected sales spikes in data growth.

---

### 📈 2. Manually Increase Storage

| Purpose    | Scale storage size by modifying the DB instance             |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact     | Online scaling (time varies by engine and size)             |
| Best for   | Planned capacity increase                                    |

**Steps:**
- Go to RDS console → Modify → Increase allocated storage

**Use case:**  
Known consistent growth in database size over time.

### 🧹 3. Clean Up Unnecessary Data

| Purpose    | Free up space quickly                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact     | Immediate relief but temporary                                |
| Best for   | Short-term fixes                                             |

**Examples:**
- Purge old logs, temporary tables, debug data
- Rotate audit or logging tables to S3

---

### 🔄 4. Optimize Tables & Indexes

| Purpose    | Reclaim fragmented space and improve performance             |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Best for   | Databases with frequent updates/deletes                      |

**Commands:**
- MySQL: `OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name;`
- PostgreSQL: `VACUUM FULL;`

---

### 🗄️ 5. Offload Cold Data

| Purpose    | Archive old/unused data to cheaper storage                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact     | Long-term cost savings                                        |
| Best for   | Historical data not frequently accessed                       |

**Example:**  
Move sales records older than 2 years into S3 + Athena for querying.

---

### 🔔 6. Proactive Monitoring

| Purpose    | Avoid hitting storage limits unexpectedly                     |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Impact     | Alerts before failure                                         |
| Best for   | All environments                                             |

**Steps:**
- Set CloudWatch alarm on `FreeStorageSpace` metric
- Configure SNS notifications for DBAs or DevOps

---

## 🧠 Real-World Insight

> “In production, we always enable storage auto-scaling with a max threshold and set CloudWatch alarms. For cost savings, we archive cold data to S3. This prevents RDS crashes from full storage while optimizing costs.”

## Summary Table

| Action                | Immediate Relief | Long-term Fix | Downtime Risk |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Enable Auto-Scaling    | ✅               | ✅            | ❌            |
| Manually Increase Storage | ✅            | ✅            | ❌            |
| Clean Up Data          | ✅               | ❌            | ❌            |
| Optimize Tables/Indexes| ✅               | ❌            | ❌            |
| Offload Cold Data      | ❌               | ✅            | ❌            |
| Monitoring & Alerts    | ❌               | ✅            | ❌            |

---

## Key Takeaway

> “The best long-term strategy is to enable storage auto-scaling and set monitoring alerts, while using cleanup and optimization as short-term solutions.”
