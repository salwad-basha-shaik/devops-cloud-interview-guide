# AWS Challenge: IAM Role Misconfiguration for S3 Access

## Question

**Explain a recent challenge you faced with AWS and how you solved it.**

### Short Overview

This question evaluates your ability to identify and resolve real-world AWS issues. It tests both your troubleshooting skills and your understanding of AWS security best practices.

---

## Answer

A recent challenge I faced was when an EC2 instance could not upload logs to an S3 bucket due to IAM role misconfiguration.

I solved it by:
- Reviewing instance role permissions
- Updating the IAM policy to include required S3 actions
- Testing with `aws s3 cp` to validate the fix
- Enforcing bucket policies for enhanced security

---

## Detailed Explanation

In one project, application logs generated by EC2 needed to be uploaded to an S3 bucket for archival and analysis. Uploads were failing with AccessDenied errors.

Here’s how I approached the problem step by step:

---

### 🔎 1. Identifying the Issue

- Checked application logs and found **AccessDenied** errors for S3 uploads.
- Verified the EC2 instance had an IAM role attached, but permissions were limited.

---

### 🛠️ 2. Root Cause

The IAM role only had `s3:GetObject` permission but lacked the required `s3:PutObject` permission needed to upload files.

---

### ✅ 3. Solution

1. Updated the IAM policy for the EC2 role to allow both read and write:

{ “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [ { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Action”:  “s3:PutObject”, “s3:GetObject” , “Resource”: “arn:aws:s3:::my-app-logs/*” } ] }


2. Attached the updated policy to the EC2 IAM role.
3. Tested upload with:


aws s3 cp /var/log/app.log s3://my-app-logs/


Upload succeeded.

---

### 🔐 4. Security Hardening

- Restricted bucket access using a bucket policy allowing only this IAM role.
- Enabled server-side encryption for logs.
- Applied S3 lifecycle rules to move logs to Glacier for cost optimization.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Insight

> “This challenge reinforced the importance of least-privilege IAM roles. Instead of granting full S3 access, we assigned only the required actions (`PutObject`/`GetObject`) combined with a restrictive bucket policy.”

## Summary Table

| Step               | Action Taken                        | Outcome           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Issue              | EC2 failed to upload logs to S3   | Upload errors     |
| Root Cause         | IAM role missing `s3:PutObject`   | AccessDenied error |
| Solution           | Updated IAM role policy            | Upload successful  |
| Security Hardening | Added bucket policy & encryption  | Secured access     |

---

## Key Takeaway

> “Always start AWS troubleshooting by checking IAM permissions and bucket policies. Misconfigured IAM roles are among the most common causes of S3 access issues.”
