## Answer

In my current organization, I am working on an Enterprise DevOps Platform and Observability Project aimed at automating CI/CD pipelines, enhancing cloud infrastructure, and improving system observability across multiple enterprise applications.

### Project Highlights:
- **Objective:** Streamline DevOps processes, improve automation, ensure security compliance, and provide real-time observability for enterprise applications.  
- **Scope:** CI/CD pipeline orchestration, infrastructure as code (IaC), monitoring & alerting, and security integration.  
- **Technologies Used:**  
  - CI/CD & Orchestration: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Opsera, Kubernetes, Docker  
  - Cloud Platforms: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, EKS, RDS, CloudWatch, Route53)  
  - IaC & Automation: Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible  
  - Observability & Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, Tempo, OpenTelemetry  
  - Security & Compliance: SonarQube, Twistlock, Nexus IQ, Invicti
